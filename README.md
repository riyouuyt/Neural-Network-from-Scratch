# Neural Network Project
This project is a neural network implementation for digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. It is inspired by Samson Zhang's tutorial on YouTube, titled "Building a Neural Network from Scratch" [Link to YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU&t=1675s&pp=ygUObmV1cmFsIG5ldHdvcms%3D).

## Overview
The goal of this project is to build a neural network model that can accurately recognize handwritten digits. The MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, is used for training and evaluating the model. The project demonstrates the process of designing and training a neural network from scratch.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

* neural_network.py: Contains the implementation of the neural network, including functions for initializing parameters, forward and backward propagation, updating parameters, and training the model.
* data_prep.py: Preprocesses the MNIST dataset by transforming it into numpy arrays, shuffling the data, and splitting it into training and testing sets.
* Neural Network.ipynb: Executes the training process and evaluates the model's performance on the test set. It also displays sample predictions and calculates the accuracy.
* README.md: The documentation file you are currently reading.

Getting Started
To run the project, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository to your local machine or download the project files.
* Install the required dependencies mentioned in the requirements.txt file.
* Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
* Run the ipynb script using Python: python main.py.
